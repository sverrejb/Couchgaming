Folder V1 has the original script, intended for my MiniPC used with SteamLink to stream games from my gaming rig:


Script for setting up my Xbox-controller to trigger on a specific button combo, doing:
* Rumble the controller, to indicate that the combo is correctly triggered.
* Turn on the TV using Wake On LAN
* Set TV to the right HDMI-input using [alga](https://github.com/Tenzer/alga)
* Wake my desktop PC using a WoL
* Start Steamlink on the Media PC

I ended up converting my Windows gaming rig into a Bazzite Steam Box for the living room, V2 is a modified script for that one:

* Turn on the TV using Wake On LAN
* Set TV to the right HDMI-input using [alga](https://github.com/Tenzer/alga)
